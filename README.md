# IMDB_Webscraper
This program written in Python displays a user menu that offers the user two choices: 1. The user can choose to have the current most popular movies displayed with their rank and other information, and 2. The user can choose to have the most recent movie news snippets displayed off of IMDB. The core technology of this program is a webscraper that utilizes the BeautifulSoup Python module as well as the requests module. This project is a work in progress but its main function is to show an ability to write web scraping applications, Regular Expressions, and Python code itself.

This project was created by Elijah N. Lozano.
